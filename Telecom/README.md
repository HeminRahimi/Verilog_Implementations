# FPGA‚ÄêBased OFDM Link Optimization through Frequency, Clock, and Timing Offset Corrections

## Project Overview

This repository contains design components for an FPGA-based Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) communication link, focusing on the critical task of signal synchronization. The project aims to optimize link performance by implementing and analyzing algorithms for correcting:

*   **CFO (Carrier Frequency Offset)**
*   **SCO (Sampling Clock Offset)**
*   **Timing Offset**

## Important Note on the Contained Designs

The implemented designs are located in the following directories:
*   [`/CFO_estimation/`](./CFO_estimation/)
*   [`/Sample_Timing_Offset/`](./Sample_Timing_Offset/)

**Please note:** These designs are **not the final version** of the complete system and are provided as individual modules for analysis and development. They are **not necessarily synthesizable** in their current state and should be considered as **proof-of-concept** implementations for algorithm validation and testing.
